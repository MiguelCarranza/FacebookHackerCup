# Facebook Hacker Cup

## Overview

Bunch of scripts to solve [Facebook's Hacker Cup](https://www.facebook.com/hackercup/) problems. Not clean code at all, just attemps to write *good* solutions to these problems using Python. 

The purposes of coding these scripts are mainly fun, trying to improve my Python skills and, like always, training my algorithms foundations and problem solving skills.


## Running the scripts

Just do 

		$ python <name_of_the_script>.py <input_file> <output_file>
		
To run the tests:

		$ python <name_of_the_script>_tests.py
